npm install
```

3. Run locally:
```bash
node index.js
```

Or deploy to Render:
- Push to GitHub and connect to Render.
- In Render, add the same environment variables (preferred: set TOKEN there, don't store it in repo).

## Usage

```
!ticketpanel
```
to post the select-menu ticket panel.

- Users select category â†’ private ticket channel is created.
- Buttons inside the ticket: Close Ticket, Save Transcript.

**Security note:** Do NOT share your bot token with anyone. Keep it secret.
